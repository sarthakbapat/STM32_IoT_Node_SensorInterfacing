# STM32_IoT_Node_SensorInterfacing
The project reads the on-board temperature, pressure and humidity sensors for STM32 discovery IoT node and displays the data on the UART. The sensor readings could be viewed on serial client like Tera-term. The baud rate used for communication is 115200. ST's Board Support Packages (BSP) are used to read the on-board sensor values.
